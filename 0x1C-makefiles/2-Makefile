##      Create your first useful Makefile.
## Requirements:
##  name of the executable: school
##  rules: all
##  The all rule builds your executable
##  variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, NAME
##  CC: the compiler to be used
##  SRC: the .c files
##  OBJ: the .o files
##  NAME: the name of the executable
##  The all rule should recompile only the updated source files
##  You are not allowed to have a list of all the .o files

CC = gcc
SRC = main.c school.c
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)
NAME = school

## By declaring 'all' as 'PHONY', 'make' considers the file 'school' as outdated and creats a new one
.PHONY : all

all: $(OBJ)
	$(CC) $(OBJ) -o $(NAME)

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) -c $< -o $@
