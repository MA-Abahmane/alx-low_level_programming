## Requirements:
##  name of the executable: school
##  rules: all
##  The all rule builds your executable
##  variables: CC, SRC
##  CC: the compiler to be used
##  SRC: the .c files

CC = gcc
SRC = main.c school.c

## By declaring 'all' as 'PHONY', 'make' considers the file 'school' as outdated and creats a new one
.PHONY: all

all: $(SRC)
	$(CC) $(SRC) -o school
